# Code Quiz

Take a timed quiz on 90's console games. For every correct answer you will gain 5 seconds, and for every wrong answer, you will lose 10. However many seconds you have remaining will be your score. Press the start button to play.

## About the Project

For this assignment we were asked to meet the following criteria:

    GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
    WHEN I click the start button
    THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
    WHEN I answer a question
    THEN I am presented with another question
    WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
    THEN time is subtracted from the clock
    WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
    THEN the game is over
    WHEN the game is over
    THEN I can save my initials and score
